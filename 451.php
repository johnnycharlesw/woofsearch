    <h1>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons</h1>
    <p>
        It looks like this webpage is part of a book that is currently being burned to enforce government censorship.
        <p style="color:transparent;">
            Psst...the government did not want you to know this, but you can get around this by using a VPN.
            Just a note.
